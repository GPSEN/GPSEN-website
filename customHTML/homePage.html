                <p>Say our name backwards and you will know what GPSEN does: we are a network that uses sustainability education to create a greater Portland.</p>

                <p>As a multi-sector collaborative network of educators, students, non-profits, political and industry leaders, organizations, and community members, we promote formal and non-formal education, training, and public awareness campaigns to help create a sustainable future for the greater Portland region, including Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties, in Oregon, and Clark County in Washington.</p>
