			<h3 class="blueHeaders">About GPSEN</h3>
			The Greater Portland Sustainability Education Network (GPSEN) is a multi-sector network of educators, students, non-profits, political and industry leaders, organizations, and community members collaborating to promote sustainability education in the Portland Metro region, including Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties, in Oregon, and Clark County in Washington.

			Acknowledged as a <a href="http://www.rce-network.org/portal/" target="_blank">Regional Center of Expertise (RCE)</a> on education for sustainable development (ESD), by the United Nations University, in 2013, we are part of a coalition of 138 RCEs around the world.

			We were recently recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by the IRS and are currently in the process of setting up a membership structure and development plan to expand our capacity to help create a sustainable future – focused on the Greater Portland Metro area, and linking our work with global efforts.

			<h3 class="blueHeaders">Values</h3>
			<strong>Sustainability:</strong> We believe in the power of: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership. We embrace practices that support care for self, care for each other, and care for Earth. We commit to using a systems-based approach that honors interdependence, nurtures meaningful relationships and networks, and fosters synergies, allowing our communities, environment, and economies to thrive.

			<strong>Inclusive participation:</strong> We commit to living our values by working together to ensure a resilient and thriving Greater Portland, both now and into the future. This involves respect for diversity of all ages and generations, nationalities, educational levels, and socioeconomic groups. We value and draw from the knowledge and wisdom of all participants, locally and globally, and recognize that expertise comes from lived experience. All voices must be involved, welcomed, and fully heard to create a community that is not only sustainable but also flourishing.

			<strong>Equity and Environmental Justice:</strong> We promote equity and social and environmental justice, in order to help create healthy, vibrant, and thriving communities. Inequities must be honestly examined so that environmental, social, and economic benefits and burdens are shared in fair and equitable ways.

			<strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> We commit to being open and honest in our governance and practices, providing access to our records, creating feedback loops for improvement, and modeling true learning as an organization, through our mistakes and successes.

			<strong>Innovation:</strong> We value and invest in visionary processes, technologies, and solutions-based strategies that empower lifelong learners to critically examine the foundations of social issues and engage in their communities. Through innovation, dialogue, resource sharing, community-based research and transformative, lifelong learning, we will offer avenues to help develop local and global solutions.

			<strong>Transformative Learning:</strong>  Our network is dedicated to thinking outside the box and creating opportunities where varying ways of teaching, learning, and knowing can thrive.
