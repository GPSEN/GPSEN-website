                    <p>The Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) are multi-sector networks of organizations that support formal, non-formal and informal sustainability education efforts in local and regional communities. They create a knowledge base to support stakeholders and sustainability providers and promote four major goals: collaborative partnerships and governance; projects and programs; transformative education; and research and development.</p>
                    <p>A network of RCEs worldwide constitute a Global Learning Space, offering innovative platforms to share knowledge, expertise, and best practices and to promote dialogue on sustainable development efforts and initiatives.  As of January 2016, there are 146 RCEs around the world, as acknowledged by the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS) and supported by the RCE Service Centre, in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

                    <p>RCEs aspire to translate global objectives into their local communities. Upon the completion of the Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) in 2014, RCEs are asked to generate, accelerate, and mainstream ESD by implementing the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco-world-conference-on-esd-2014/esd-after-2014/global-action-programme/">Global Action Programme (GAP) on ESD</a> and help implement the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="blueHeaders">RCE Mission</h3>
                    <p>International platforms exist to tackle sustainability challenges. The RCE Service Centre has
                        identified the following priorities: the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php" target="_blank">United Nations
                            Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a>; the <a href="http://www.unep.org/10yfp/" target="_blank">10 Year Framework Programme on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP on SCP)</a>; and the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/">Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</a> and <a href="http://www.ipbes.net/">Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</a>.</p>
                    <p>RCEs are uniquely placed to help create solutions to these sustainability challenges and more.
                        They are influential policy advocates and help prepare local leaders and community members
                        with the tools and information they need to make smart and sustainable choices for themselves
                        and their communities. RCE efforts encourage innovative approaches to sustainable development
                        and translate existing knowledge into concrete actions. The success each RCE achieves on the
                        local level is brought to scale through the global RCE Network.</p>
