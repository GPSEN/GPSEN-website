            <a href="http://www.sustainabilitytest.org/">International Sustainability Literacy Test Available for Piloting Now through September 2014</a>

            The International Sustainability Literacy Test is a free, on-line multiple choice question assessment, with customized versions for different countries and regions of the world. It attempts to assess a student’s basic level of knowledge about sustainability – including social and environmental responsibility – and can be administered in any college-level course, undergraduate or graduate. It is designed to provide the first world-wide picture of the sustainability knowledge of our students.  More than 150 academics, NGOs, corporations, and volunteers from 25 countries participated in the development and early testing phase of the tool, and the current target is to have 100,000 students take the test.  Colleagues at Kedge Business School in France are leading the effort, working with many other countries to develop the test instrument and process.

            The piloting phase is occurring through September.  Please consider participating by signing up and administering the test during the next few weeks.  For questions, contact the U.S. National &amp; Regional Committee at  <a href="mailto:USA@sustainabilitytest.org">USA@sustainabilitytest.org</a> or the General Secretariat for the test at <a href="mailto:contact@sustainabilitytest.org">contact@sustainabilitytest.

            As a measure of commitment towards protecting our heritage for years to come, the State of Oregon passed legislation to create this environmental literacy plan (HB2544), designed to ensure that every student in Oregon becomes a lifelong steward of their environment and community, willing and able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of environmental citizenship, choosing to interact frequently with the outdoor environment, equipped with multifaceted knowledge of our relationship to the environment and its resources, and prepared to address challenges with sound decisions for our future.
