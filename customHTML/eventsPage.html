      <p>GPSEN is recognized as a Regional Centre of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development by the United Nations University and is part of a network of 136 RCEs around the world to help support a more sustainable future.  Organized into continental groups, we are joining the RCEs of the North, Central, and South America this summer to share best practices and coordinate efforts.  You are invited!</p>
      <p>The conference will provide a global platform that elevates the conversation around education for sustainable development with a focus on the impact of water resources. We welcome leaders from countries throughout the Americas and also the world, who are influential thinkers, researchers, authors, academics, and educators.  We hope you will join us.</p>
