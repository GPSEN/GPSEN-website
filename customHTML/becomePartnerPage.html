            <p><strong>GPSEN</strong> has grown into a robust, collaborative organization that increases education, training, and public awareness for sustainability across the greater Portland region.  We develop partnerships and co-create outreach tools, curriculum, and events, while encouraging transformative ideas, research, and practices.  Our regional, national, and international impact has evolved, expanding beyond current staff and volunteer capacity.  Many GPSEN partners have generously provided funding, in-kind donations, and staff support during our incubation period.  We now need your support to move to the next stage and invite all stakeholders to become GPSEN partners to help create a sustainable future together.</p>
            <p>To become a partner, all individuals and organizations must <a href="http://gpsen.org/about/">align with the GPSEN mission</a> and support collaborative efforts to promote sustainability within the region.</p>
